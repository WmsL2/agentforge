# Manual setup steps for agentforge

The generator created the code. These are the **one-time external setup steps**
that can't be automated — accounts to create, keys to copy, services to provision.

> Skip ahead to "After every deploy" at the bottom for things you'll re-do
> regularly. Items above are one-time per environment.

## Secrets

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Then in `backend/.env`:

- [ ] **`SECRET_KEY`** — replace with a fresh value: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] **`API_KEY`** — replace with a fresh value: `openssl rand -hex 32`

These are used to sign JWTs and authenticate service-to-service calls. Rotate at every environment promotion (dev → staging → prod each get their own).

## PostgreSQL

- [ ] Provision a PostgreSQL ≥ 14 instance (local: `docker compose up -d db`; managed: Neon / Supabase / RDS / Cloud SQL).
- [ ] Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to the **async** connection string: `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:5432/dbname`.
- [ ] Run migrations: `cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head`.

## AgentForge Platform Runtime

Configure an OpenAI-compatible provider in `backend/.env`:

- [ ] Set `LLM_PROVIDER` to an identity label such as `openai`, `deepseek`, or
  `custom`. It is metadata only and does not select provider-specific code.
- [ ] Set `LLM_API_KEY` to the provider credential.
- [ ] Set `LLM_BASE_URL` when the provider requires a compatible custom endpoint;
  leave it empty to use the client's default endpoint.
- [ ] Set `AI_MODEL` and optionally `AI_TEMPERATURE` for the configured provider.

`OPENAI_API_KEY` remains separate legacy configuration for the inherited
template chat subsystem. It is not required by AgentForge Platform Runtime.

## Redis

- [ ] Local: `docker compose up -d redis` (already in compose file).
- [ ] Managed: Upstash / Redis Cloud / ElastiCache. Set `REDIS_URL` in `.env`.

---

## After every deploy

- [ ] Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head` (CI step or post-deploy job).
- [ ] Smoke test `/api/v1/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
- [ ] Frontend loads, login → dashboard flow works.
- [ ] Logs flowing to your aggregator.
